# Yay or Nay Project Proposal

## Team Members

## Overview
- Demographic consensus tool that allows users to rate anything and everything YAY or NAY. Using Facebook Login user information will be extracted to create powerful data on demographic differences in preferences. Users can view preference data based on age, gender and region.

## Beta Version Goals
- Facebook Login
	- Users will login using Facebook. We can extract insightful information from our users using this.
- Completed Basic Front-end
	- Sign-in (using Facebook) and Profile Page
	- Rating, searching and commenting on items
- Simple Item Search
	- Retrieving items based on simple text matching


## Final Version Goals
- New Item Submission using A.I:
	- User will submit items and the application will approve without human intervention. Using A.I the application will deem the item appropriate.
- Trending items
	- Trending items based on the amount of searches and ratings in the past 24 hours (or other time period)
- Context-aware search
	- Users can search for items without having a perfect match to their input text. This will be achieved using IBM Watson and Datamuse APIs.

## Technologies
- React.js
	- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is designed around the concept of reusable components. You define small components and you put them together to form bigger components. React is one of the most popular Javascript libraries. 
- MongoDB
	- NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas. This will be used to store our items, as well as users.
- IBM Watson: Natural Language Understanding
	- Using Watson NLU clients can analyze text to extract metadata from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, relations and semantic roles.

## Technical Challenges
1. Learning and developing using React.js
    - We would like to design and develop our front-end using React.js, while we have some experience using this front-end library we will be learning it's advanced features as we develop. As with any new framework, there will be a learning curve.
2.  Real-time Analytics - Using graphs to represent our data
    - The application will feature real-time analytics of the demographic consensus data. We will have to find a way to efficiently convey this data and update it on the fly. Our goal is to use multiple representations for the data and as such we must use the most suitable front-end tools such as Chart.js.
3. AI Based Approval System
    - Using IBM Watson to appropriately accept and reject new item request from users. Using Natural Language Understanding our application will have to analyze the input text and verify if it is a valid rateable item. We will have to carefully develop this feature as we do not want to reject valid items, or accept items that are not suitable.
4.  AI Based Search Engine
    - Using IBM Watson and Datamuse we will implement a context-aware search engine that tries to strengthen the userâ€™s input to yield stronger results. To make this effective we will need to put in careful thought during the development process.
5. Designing and intuitive UI
    - As with any application, an intuitive UI is extremely important. Our application has multiple layers such as item submission, user profiles and the application dashboard so we will have to make sure to carefully design it so it is not convoluted.
